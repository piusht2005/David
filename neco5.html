  <h1>Malpractice Prevention Guidelines</h1>
  <p>Exam malpractice can ruin your academic career and damage your future. NECO has zero tolerance for cheating, and students must take the guidelines seriously.</p>

  <h2>Tips to Avoid Malpractice:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Don't take phones or unauthorized materials into the exam hall</li>
    <li>Avoid talking or copying from others during the exam</li>
    <li>Stay focused and manage your time wisely</li>
    <li>Report any suspicious activity to supervisors</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Remember, it’s better to fail with integrity than pass through cheating and get caught. Work hard, and trust your preparation.</p>
