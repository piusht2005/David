  <h1>Core Subjects: English & Mathematics</h1>
  <p>English Language and Mathematics are the foundation of every WAEC result. They are compulsory and often determine your overall success.</p>

  <h2>Why They're Crucial:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>They are required for admission into any course in Nigerian universities</li>
    <li>Failure in any of them can invalidate your WAEC result (i.e., not qualified for most courses)</li>
    <li>They're used to calculate your O’Level points in admissions like JAMB and Post-UTME</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Put extra effort into mastering these two subjects. Use past questions, attend tutorials, and study smart.</p>
